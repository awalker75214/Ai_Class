Step 1 — Start the AI Game Engine

Run this command:

    curl http://localhost:11434/api/generate \
    -d '{
      "model": "llama3.2",
      "stream": false,
      "prompt": "You are a fantasy dungeon game master. Start a short adventure. Keep responses under 5 sentences. Begin now."
    }'

Step 2 — Make Your First Move
Now respond to the AI.

Example command:

curl http://localhost:11434/api/generate \
-d '{
  "model": "llama3.2",
  "stream": false,
  "prompt": "Continue the dungeon adventure. The player chooses to go left quietly."
}'

Step 3 — Try Fun Moves
Let's try commands like:

"prompt": "Continue the adventure. The player throws a shoe at the dragon."

"prompt": "Continue the adventure. The player casts a cloud computing spell."

"prompt": "Continue the adventure. The player tries to order pizza in the dungeon."
