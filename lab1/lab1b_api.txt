🖥️ Step 1 — Ensure Ollama Is Running

Run:
    ollama serve

Most systems auto-start it, but this guarantees it.

You should see:
    Listening on 127.0.0.1:11434

This means:
👉 AI API server is running locally.

🧠 Explain to Students

This is exactly like starting:
    Nginx
    Docker daemon
    MySQL service

You just started an AI service.

🧪 Step 2 — Test API Connectivity

Run:
    curl http://localhost:11434

Expected output:
    Ollama is running

🧠 What This Means

You just confirmed:
    A local API server exists
    It is reachable
    It is ready to receive requests

This is standard cloud engineering validation.
