🖥️ Step 1 — Ensure Ollama Is Running

Run:
    ollama serve

Most systems auto-start it, but this guarantees it.

You should see:
    Listening on 127.0.0.1:11434

This means:
👉 AI API server is running locally.

🧠 Explain to Students

This is exactly like starting:
    Nginx
    Docker daemon
    MySQL service

You just started an AI service.

🧪 Step 2 — Test API Connectivity

Run:
    curl http://localhost:11434

Expected output:
    Ollama is running

🧠 What This Means

You just confirmed:
    A local API server exists
    It is reachable
    It is ready to receive requests

This is standard cloud engineering validation.

🧪 Step 3 — Send Your First AI API Request

Now we send a JSON request to the model.

Run This Command

        curl http://localhost:11434/api/generate \
        -d '{
          "model": "llama3.2",
          "prompt": "Explain cloud computing in one sentence.",
          "stream": false
        }'

🎉 What Happens

You will receive:

        {
          "response": "Cloud computing is..."
        }

You just:

✔ Called an AI API
✔ Sent JSON data
✔ Received a JSON response

This is EXACTLY how cloud services work.

🧠 Reemmber this

This is no different than calling:
        AWS Lambda API
        Azure REST services
        GCP endpoints

AI is just another service.

🧪 Step 4 — Send a Fun Prompt via API

Try this:

        curl http://localhost:11434/api/generate \
        -d '{
          "model": "llama3.2",
          "prompt": "Write a funny message from a tired cloud engineer.",
          "stream": false
        }'

Students love seeing:

👉 AI responses through automation.

🧪 Step 5 — Pretty Print the Output (Optional)
Install jq if needed:

        sudo apt install jq

Then run:

        curl http://localhost:11434/api/generate \
        -d '{
          "model": "llama3.2",
          "prompt": "What is AWS in simple terms?",
          "stream": false
        }' | jq

This formats JSON cleanly.


🧠 Why This Matters to you! 

You just learned how to:
        Send REST API requests
        Automate AI interactions
        Integrate AI into systems

This is exactly how companies use AI.

🎯 Lab Success Criteria

You pass if:

✔ curl http://localhost:11434 works
✔ You sent an API request
✔ You received a JSON response

That’s it.
