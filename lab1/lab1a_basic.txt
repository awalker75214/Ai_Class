🧠 Before We Start — Important Mindset

This lab is NOT about:

    Becoming an AI expert
    Understanding machine learning math
    Writing complex code
    Paying child support, oh hell no.

This lab IS about:

👉 Learning how to run an AI service on a computer.

Just like you learned to run:
    Docker
    MySQL
    Nginx

This is simply another service.

🖥️ Step 1 — Install Ollama

🪟 Windows

Download from:
https://ollama.com/download
Run the installer.

That’s it.

🍎 macOS

Download from:
https://ollama.com/download
Drag to Applications.

🐧 Linux (Ubuntu)

      Run:  curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh

✅ Step 2 — Verify Installation

Open a terminal and run:
      ollama --version

Expected output:
    ollama version X.X.X

If you see a version number:
    👉 You succeeded.

This means:

You have installed an AI runtime. Congrats, Skynet is watching you.

Just like installing:
Docker Engine
Kubernetes CLI
Terraform

If you see Lizzo:
    👉 Bruh...

She will eat you for dinner.
