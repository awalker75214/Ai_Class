LAB 4 — Python + Ollama
Build an Interactive “Nightmare Date” Game Client
What you’re building
(Haunted.....)

A tiny terminal app that:

✅ asks for name and location
✅ generates the Nightmare Date intro
✅ lets the student type choices (“run”, “hide”, “ask for the check”)
✅ continues the story each turn
✅ cleanly exits

0) Pre-Req: Ollama is running

In a terminal (leave it running):

ollama serve
curl http://localhost:11434

1) Create a folder + file
mkdir ollama_python_lab
cd ollama_python_lab
touch nightmare_date.py

2) Paste this code into nightmare_date.py
