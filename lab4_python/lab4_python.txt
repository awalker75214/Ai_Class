LAB 4 — Python + Ollama
Build an Interactive “Nightmare Date” Game Client
What you’re building
(Haunted.....)

A tiny terminal app that:

✅ asks for name and location
✅ generates the Nightmare Date intro
✅ lets the student type choices (“run”, “hide”, “ask for the check”)
✅ continues the story each turn
✅ cleanly exits

0) Pre-Req: Ollama is running

In a terminal (leave it running):

ollama serve
curl http://localhost:11434

1) Create a folder + file
mkdir ollama_python_lab
cd ollama_python_lab
touch nightmare_date.py

2) Paste this code into nightmare_date.py

https://github.com/BalericaAI/Ai_Class/blob/main/lab4_python/python/nightmare_date.py

3) Run it

Linux: python3 nightmare_date.py
Evil Box: python nightmare_date.py

Troubleshooting (the 3 common fails)
1) “Could not reach Ollama…”
    Fix: start it in another terminal: ollama serve

2) “model not found”
    Fix: pull the model once: ollama run llama3.2  Then quit /bye and run Python again.

3) Python not installed
    Fix: use system Python or install Python 3.11+.

Bonus 

Modify one thing:
    1) Change MODEL = "llama3.2" to another model they’ve installed
    2) Change response length: “under 4 sentences”
    3) Add a “plot twist” requirement: “include a haunted ringtone”
