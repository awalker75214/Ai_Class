Lab Goal (Tell Students)

In this lab you will:

✅ Provide your name and location

✅ Experience AI as an interactive storytelling engine
✅ Practice sending dynamic prompts

You are going on a date with Keisha

But…  Something is wrong.
Very wrong.

Keisha knows where you live..... now you enter.... 

👉 A horror movie narrator
👉 A chaotic dating simulator
👉 A zombie apocalypse storyteller


Step 1 — Choose Your Inputs

Students must pick:
    Their name
    A location

Examples:
    Keisha — Atlanta coffee shop trick
    Maria — Paris restaurant
    Samatha — Tokyo subway

Step 2 — Start the Nightmare Date
Students replace NAME and LOCATION below.

    curl http://localhost:11434/api/generate \
    -d '{
      "model": "llama3.2",
      "stream": false,
      "prompt": "Create a humorous spooky horror story about a nightmare date. The main character is YO MOMMA. The date takes place at CHEWBACCA'S HOUSE. Include light horror movie elements, creepy atmosphere, and a sudden zombie twist. Keep it under 6 sentences and not graphic."
    }'

Example Filled In

    curl http://localhost:11434/api/generate \
    -d '{
      "model": "llama3.2",
      "stream": false,
      "prompt": "Create a humorous spooky horror story about a nightmare date. The main character is Alex. The date takes place at an Austin coffee shop. Include light horror movie elements, creepy atmosphere, and a sudden zombie twist. Keep it under 6 sentences and not graphic."
    }'

What Happens

Students get something like:

You sat nervously at the coffee shop while Keisha stared without blinking.
The lights flickered and the barista slowly backed away.
Suddenly, Keisha whispered, “Do you like brains… or just lattes?”
Outside, people shuffled strangely toward the windows.
You realized this wasn’t just a bad date — it was a Keisha outbreak.

🎭 Optional Variations (Very Fun)
Students can modify prompts like:

🧟 Zombie Date at Work
“Nightmare date at a corporate office during a zombie outbreak”

👻 Haunted Dinner Date
“Nightmare date at a haunted restaurant where ghosts are the waiters”

🤖 AI Date Gone Wrong
